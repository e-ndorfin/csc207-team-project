# Team Contract

## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

We will use Instagram for communication between members. We agree to respond to messages within a day (24 hours) of the message. We will also inform the group if we cannot make a deadline or if we have to miss a lab / meeting. 

## Decision Making

Decisions will be made by majority vote. 

## Conflict resolution

We will resolve conflict by calmly speaking with each other (face to face ideally). If this is not possible, we will talk to our TA to help resolve this conflict. 

## Accountability

We only ask that each member complete the work assigned to them, and for them to speak up if the work is too much given other commitments / deadlines. 

By signing below, we acknowledge that we have read, discussed, and agreed to these terms. We understand that this contract is binding for the duration of the course and may be revised with the agreement of all team members.
